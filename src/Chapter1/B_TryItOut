//Coding philosophy set up
Try it out --> make mistake is a great way to learn.
The more you practice the better you become, finally you'll be fully-fledged.

//compiler, interpreter;
//JDK = compiler + debugger + JRE,
//JRE = .jar library + JVM.
.java --> compiler --> .class

                            it analyses the byte codes and carries out the operations.

//public, private = accessibility， accessible from outside of class
//static = method can be executed even no class objects have been created
Encapusulation, refer to "hiding items" (variables and methods) within an object
                by specifying them as "private" in the definition of the class.
                The "internal code can be changed in any way that you want".

public, means its globally accessiable
static, means ensure its accessibale even though no objects of the class exist. --> There is no object in class System.
